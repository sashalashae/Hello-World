* On my honor:
*
* - I have not discussed the C++ language code in my program with
* anyone other than my instructor or the teaching assistants
* assigned to this course.
* - I have not used C++ language code obtained from another student,
* or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified.
* - If any C++ language code or documentation used in my program
* was obtained from another source, such as a text book of coarse
* notes, that has been clearly noted with a proper citation in
* the comments of my program.
* - I have not designed this program in such a way as to defeat or
* interfere with the normal operation of the Web-Cat Server.
